# Let's Start - Personal Starter Kit

A modern, full-stack personal starter kit built with Turborepo for rapid project development.

## Overview

**Let's Start** is a comprehensive starter kit designed to jumpstart full-stack web applications. It leverages the power of Turborepo to manage a monorepo containing both frontend and backend applications with shared tooling and configurations.

## Tech Stack

### Frontend
- **React 19** with **TypeScript**
- **Vite** for blazing-fast development and building
- **Tailwind CSS** for utility-first styling
- **shadcn/ui** for beautiful, accessible UI components

### Backend
- **Hono** - Fast, lightweight web framework
- **Drizzle ORM** for type-safe database operations
- **better-auth** for authentication and user management
- **pg** - PostgreSQL client library for database connections
- **PGlite** - Lightweight in-memory PostgreSQL for testing

### Testing
- **Bun Test Runner** for fast, modern testing

### Development Tools
- **Turborepo** for monorepo management
- **TypeScript** for static type checking
- **Biome** for code linting and formatting

## Project Structure

```
lets-start/
â”œâ”€â”€ apps/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ frontend/          # React + Vite frontend application
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ backend/           # Hono backend API
â””â”€â”€ turbo.json           # Turborepo configuration
```

## Apps

- `frontend`: A React 19 application built with Vite, featuring Tailwind CSS and shadcn/ui components
- `backend`: A Hono-based API server with Drizzle ORM, better-auth authentication, and PostgreSQL database

# Backend only  
bun run dev --filter=backend
```

### Building

Build all apps and packages:

```bash
bun run build
```

Build a specific app:

```bash
bun run build --filter=frontend

bun run build --filter=backend
```

### Testing

Run tests across all packages:

```bash
bun run test
```
